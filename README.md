# 100-Days-Of-Python-Code
I will be coding various projects using Python with an intention to strengthen my Python skills.

## Day 7
In this section the focus is in developing a word-guessing game that will allow a user to guess a 
letter that is part of the generated word. If the user guesses a correct letter, they will be 
informed that the letter that they have chosen is correct and the position of that letter will be
revealed. The user will continue to guess the letters up until the word is complete or up until 
the user has used up all their lives which are 6 lives, this is be demonstrated by the ASCII art of 
a hangman.
