# 100-Days-Of-Python-Code
I will be coding various projects using Python with an intention to strengthen my Python skills.
I will be developing projects that I will interact with in the command line, learn web development, 
web scraping and many other development-based skills.

## Day 7
In this section, the focus is in developing a word-guessing game that will allow a user to guess a 
letter that is part of the generated word. If the user guesses a correct letter, they will be 
informed that the letter that they have chosen is correct and the position of that letter will be
revealed. The user will continue to guess the letters up until the word is complete or up until 
the user has used up all their lives which are 6 lives, this is be demonstrated by the ASCII art of 
a hangman. If the user guesses an incorrect letter, a man who is hanging himself will start to be
drawn, when a full hangman is drawn, that will symbolize that the user did not get the word and 
the user's lives are depleted.

## Day 8
This day was focused on developing an encoding and decoding algorithm that is based on the caeser
encryption method that allows a user to send an encrypted message and allow the decryption of that
message as well.

## Day 9
Silent Auction is a system that allows bidders to bid silently without them knowing what other 
bidders have bidded. The highest bidder will be revealed after everyone has submitted their bid and 
there are no more bids that are accepted.

## Day 10
Basic calculator app to perform basic calculations utilizing basic operators.

## Day 11
The program for this day was to develop a blackjack game that would allow a user to play with the 
computer. The functionality of this game includes some of the main rules while omitting some features.

## Day 12
This project was about allowing a user to guess the number that is randomly generated, if they guessed
incorrect, they would be informed if their guess was high or low, these guesses will continue up until
the number of attempts are depleted or the number guessed is correct. 

## Day 13 and 14
These two days focused on a comparative program based on the number of followers a user has, two public
figures will be randomly shown on the screen then a user will guess which one has more Instagram followers
than the other. If guessed correctly, the user will continue to guess, if guessed incorrectly, the game will
abort and the final score of the user will be shown.

## Day 15
This day focused on developing a coffee machine program that allows users to purchase coffee of their liking provided
that the ingredients of that coffee exist. The report of the coffee machine shop can be generated to check the available
ingredients after a purchase.
